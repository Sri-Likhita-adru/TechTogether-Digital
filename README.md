# Vite + React

## üí° Inspiration
Studies say that more than half of the workers of marginalized gender have experienced unfair treatment at work at some point in their lives. So we want to provide a platform for people of marginalized gender to help each other by not only sharing their experience at their workplace but also post jobs of the companies they think are work-friendly. We also wanted to provide a full fledged review about the company to help workers of marginalized gender to get a better understanding about their work place before they take up their jobs. 

## üíª What it does
- Post jobs from the company that workers of marginalized gender think are work-friendly
- Accept jobs from the company that workers of marginalized gender think are work-friendly
- Some people might feel insecure about their information being shared especially when it concerns a person of marginalized gender. A decentralized storage system for user data for security purposes was implemented using Blockchain
- Get personalized recommendation based on the user's top skills
- View similar jobs based on the job that is currently being viewed
- Post reviews about the company that you worked at or is currently working in
- Get a full-fledged analyzed review about the company before you apply
- Chatroom to chat with other people of marginalized gender

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it
- Frontend: React JS
- Backend: Node JS
- Blockchain: Azure Blockchain Service
- Machine Learning: Python

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Best Use of Microsoft Cloud for Your Community
To run blockchain networks, we use **Azure Blockchain Service**. Azure Blockchain solution is a fully managed solution for creating and managing blockchain networks. It offers a unified administration interface for both consortium and public blockchain networks. We are utilising Azure Blockchain Service because it is based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum protocols, both of which are extremely beneficial to our project.

## üß† Challenges we ran into
- Data collection and data cleaning for the recommendation systems that were built was very difficult

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Built a decentralized storage system for user data for security purposes since some people might feel insecure about their information being shared especially when it concerns a person of marginalized gender.
- Users can post jobs from the company that workers of marginalized gender think are work-friendly
- Users can accept jobs from the company that workers of marginalized gender think are work-friendly
- Built a personalized recommendation to suggest jobs based on the user's top skills

- Users can post reviews about the company that you worked at or is currently working in
- We provide a full-fledged analyzed review about the company that users can refer before they apply
