To run blockchain networks, we use **Azure Blockchain Service**. Azure Blockchain solution is a fully managed solution for creating and managing blockchain networks. It offers a unified administration interface for both consortium and public blockchain networks. We are utilising Azure Blockchain Service because it is based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum protocols, both of which are extremely beneficial to our project.
